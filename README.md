## Work / Project Examples

### Grade Tracker (Solo Project)
A website that provides students insights on their academic performance. For example, calculating required scores on final exam to achieve an A+.

Contribution:
* Designed the database schema, and as a result created the ER diagram. Then, translated the schema to relations in PostgreSQL database. 
* Created a REST API with Spring Boot. Followed best practices for the API structure from [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/best-practices/api-design). The API has multiple endpoints supporting GET and POST requests. These are used for uploading course information, and downloading insights.
* Implemented user login with Google Identity service and JWT Token. Used Google's API for Java to verify users from the token provided by Google Identity service, then generated a JWT token to be used for authorizing forbidden API requests.
* Created API documentation as a README file that describes structure of post data and response data.

### Lassonde Games (Hackathon)
A website for Ontario Science Center to provide scavanger hunt themed game for each exhibition hall.

* Contributed in designing a mock UI outline with the team in Figma. 
* Created a single-page front-end with React. The front end communicates with a REST api to load data. It also allows switching between different pages without reloading the tab.

## Inspiration
### GameJolt (Open Source Website)
* I find the smooth native-like dark-themed UI inspiring. Because despite being a website, it gives a feeling of a native desktop app.

### JavaFX (Open Source Project)
* I find this library inspiring because it provides cross-platform UI tools, which can be used as an alternative of Electron because of its relative high performance.

## Focus

I would love to focus mostly on developing backend features. I would spend time studying the code base before I start contributing. In order to complete the implementation of the features, I would learn the backend tools used by the team with the help of online resources and documentation. I would also be able to spend time on the frontend if required.
